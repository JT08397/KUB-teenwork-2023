- I got to the office and look out some stuff on markdown and found a good site that showed me how to do somethings. And after that I got on call with my mentors and we made my website public.
- After I added somethings to my website like some links and blog posts.Then I got on a call with some coworkers and they all showed me some of the websites they made and give me some helpful tips.
- And then for the rest of the day I just worked on my website and added some small things. I also looked into how to add images and themes but I havent got that to work just yet.
